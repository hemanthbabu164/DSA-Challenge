Note: For Possible DP
1: Recursion
  Steps in Recursion:
  1. make the function to be based on an indexing (if array we will naturally have that )
  2. Try out all stuffs possible on that index according to the problem statement
  3. make out the base case,  
  tip :if count ,returning 1 in base case and summing up all possibilities gives an answer 
      if min, carry the cost of each possibility in that path, and return the mini of all them
2: Memoisation(DP TD)
3: Tabulation(DP BU)
4: Optimizing Space Complexity.
