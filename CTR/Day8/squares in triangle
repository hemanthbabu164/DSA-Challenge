Q)Geek has a ticket to the Geek Summer Carnival. The ticket has a positive integer B written on it.
B denotes the base of a right-angled isosceles triangle. 
Geek can avail discounts on X courses in the carnival.

X is the maximum number of squares of size 2x2 units that can fit in the given right-angled isosceles triangle. 
Find X. 


Example 1:

Input:
B = 8
Output:
6 

// code
//{ Driver Code Starts
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// } Driver Code Ends
class Solution{
    public:
    int countSquare(int B)
    {
	    // code here 
	   int ans=B/2;
	   ans-=1;
	   return (ans*(ans+1))/2;
    }
};



//{ Driver Code Starts.
int main()
{
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--)
    {
    	int B,count;
    	cin>>B;
    	Solution ob;
    	count = ob.countSquare(B);
    	cout<<count<<endl;
    }
}
// } Driver Code Ends
